# term-edit.nvim
Allowing you to edit your command in the terminal just like any other buffer.

## WIP
This is a work in progress. Use it at your own cost.

## Action Implemented
- Enter insert: `i` `a` `A` `I`

## Limitations
term-edit.nvim assumes all characters takes up one space. It assumes there are no \<Tab\> or \<CR\>.
