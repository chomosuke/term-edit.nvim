# term-edit.nvim
Allowing you to edit your command in the terminal just like any other buffer.

## WIP
This is a work in progress. Use it at your own cost.

## Action Implemented
- `i`
- `a`
- `A`: Insert at end of command
- `I`: Insert at start of command

## Limitations
term-edit.nvim assumes all characters takes up one space. It assumes there are no <Tab> or <CR>.
