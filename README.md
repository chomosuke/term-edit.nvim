# term-edit.nvim
Allowing you to edit your command in the terminal just like any other buffer.

## WIP
This is a work in progress. It might or might not work expected.

## Action Implemented
- Enter insert: `i`, `a`, `A`, `I`.
- Visual change: `c` in visual mode.
- Visual delete: `d` in visual mode.

## Limitations
term-edit.nvim assumes there are no \<Tab\> though it might tolerate it.
